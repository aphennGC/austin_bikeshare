# You are taking the bikeshare_trips table and bolting on the bikeshare_stations table twice.

# The first time, you link using the trip's start_station_id to get details about where the trip began.
# The second time, you link using the trip's end_station_id to get details about where the trip ended.
# This setup allows users exploring the data to select fields like "Trip Duration", "Start Station Name", and "End Station Council District" all in the same query.
